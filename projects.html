            <img class=" IOT IOT2" src="Images\jyp.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="p1">This was my junior year project. Our 2D plotter was capable of drawing computer processed binary images on a page. Arduino (UNO) microcontroller was used to control movements of the stepper motors along X-axis and Y-axis. Solenoid coil was used to control moment of our plotting pen on Z-axis. It basically works with two stepper motors and a solenoid, wherein the robot plots the input given from the computer on the paper. The Arduino microcontroller was used to control the movements of stepper motors. Solenoid was used for raising the pen up and down vertically. Due to cost limitations, we couldnâ€™t use position sensor in our plotter, hence we had to use physical switches.</p>

            <p class="p1">This was a digital logic design project that was comprised of total of six counters. Two for each hours, minutes and seconds.
              For each minutes and seconds two counters were used. One counts from 0-9 and other from 0-5 in order to make 59 minutes or 59 seconds. Each counter gets reset after reaching desired number. For hours section one couner counts from 0-1 while other was a 0-9 counter and the combination of two was responsible for 12 hour format. Alarm was also implemented in the clock. Overall the project was very budget freindly and used components like seven segment displays, 555 timer IC, 7493 counter IC, logic gates IC's, bread boards and a 5V power supply.</p>

            <p class="p1">This project used temprature sensors, two mini servo motors, Arduino, 16x2 LCD display and bread board as the main components.
              The project purose was to monitor the temprature of individual and compare the temprature with the threshold temprature that is set within microcontroller. The servo motors opens or closes the door based on the individual temprature.</p>

            <img class="IOT IOT2" src="Images\009.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="p1">The performance and advantages of microstrip patch antennas such as low 
              weight, low profile, and low cost made them the perfect choice for 
              communication systems engineers. They have the capability to integrate with 
              microwave circuits and therefore they are very well suited for applications such 
              as cell devices, WLAN applications, navigation systems and many others 
              In this project; a compact rectangular patch antenna was designed using COMSOL software that is used for 
              GPS devices at 1.57542 GHz, and for a satellite TV signal at 11.843 GHz and 
              11.919 GHz.</p>
